nicEdit is a lightweight, Cross Platform WYSIWYG editor

This is my (Vitaliy Filippov's) fork of nicEdit which I use in my projects since 2012.

It has several improvements:
* Table plugin
* Example plugins for "wiki-like CMS integrated" image uploads and link insertions
* Russian localisation
* Reworked nicFloatingPanel
* Sanitize pasted HTML plugin (removes all the crap that MSWord inserts)

Not sure if it's easy to merge all this to upstream, but I'll try... maybe :)
